# 📊 Student Performance Predictor

This project aims to predict students' math scores based on various numerical and categorical features such as reading and writing scores, gender, parental education level, and more.

## 🎯 Goal

To build and evaluate multiple machine learning regression models to predict the **math score** of a student, using a dataset from Kaggle: [Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977).

## 🧠 Models Used

The following regression models were trained and evaluated. The one with the best performance is selected for final predictions:

- Random Forest Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Linear Regression
- XGBoost Regressor
- CatBoost Regressor
- AdaBoost Regressor

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA & Visualization)
- Scikit-learn
- CatBoost, XGBoost
- Flask (for API)
- Custom Logging and Exception Handling
- Dill (for model serialization)
